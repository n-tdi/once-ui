## Overview
The Epi-Patch project, developed as part of the BWSI bASICs program, focuses on creating a wearable device that can detect allergic reactions and administer epinephrine in cases of anaphylactic shock. This innovative solution aims to provide a quick and efficient response to severe allergic reactions, potentially saving lives by ensuring timely treatment.

## Key Features
- **Histamine Sensor**: The Epi-Patch is equipped with a histamine sensor that continuously monitors the wearer's skin for elevated histamine levels, which are indicative of an allergic reaction. This real-time monitoring allows for early detection of potential anaphylactic events.
- **Automatic Epinephrine Injection**: Upon detecting a critical level of histamine, the Epi-Patch is designed to automatically administer a pre-loaded dose of epinephrine. This feature ensures that the user receives immediate treatment without the need for manual intervention, which can be crucial during an emergency.
- **Wearable Design**: The device is designed to be worn comfortably on the skin, similar to that of a glucose monitor. Its discreet and user-friendly design allows for continuous wear, making it suitable for individuals with severe allergies who require constant monitoring.
