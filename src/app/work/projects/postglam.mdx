Based on the information available in the [Postglam GitHub repository](https://github.com/n-tdi/Postglam), here's a detailed write-up of the project:

## Overview

Postglam is an object-oriented Java library designed to simplify interactions with PostgreSQL databases. By encapsulating database connections and operations within intuitive objects and methods, Postglam streamlines database management for developers, promoting efficient and maintainable code practices.

## Key Features

- **Object-Oriented Design**: Encapsulates PostgreSQL database interactions within Java objects, providing a clear and structured approach to database management.

- **Simplified Connection Handling**: Offers straightforward methods to establish and manage database connections, reducing boilerplate code and potential errors.

- **Structured Method Calling**: Provides a suite of methods for common database operations, enabling developers to perform tasks such as queries, updates, and schema modifications with ease.

- **Maven Integration**: Easily integrates into Java projects via Maven, allowing developers to include Postglam as a dependency and streamline their build process.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: The primary programming language for Postglam, offering robust object-oriented capabilities and widespread adoption in enterprise applications.

- **PostgreSQL**: The relational database management system that Postglam interfaces with, known for its extensibility and standards compliance.

- **Maven**: A build automation tool used for managing project dependencies, including the integration of Postglam into Java projects.

## Challenges and Learnings

Developing Postglam involved addressing challenges such as ensuring seamless integration with various PostgreSQL versions and handling diverse database schemas. The project emphasized the importance of thorough testing and the need for clear documentation to assist developers in adopting the library effectively. SQL Injection prevention and transaction management were key areas of focus to ensure the security and reliability of database operations.

## Outcome

Postglam has been successfully integrated into multiple Java projects, enhancing developer productivity by providing a structured and efficient means of interacting with PostgreSQL databases. The library's object-oriented approach has been praised for its intuitiveness and ease of use, leading to more maintainable and robust database management within applications. I've used this project in teams and personal projects, and it has significantly improved the readability and maintainability of database-related code.
