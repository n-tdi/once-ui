I recently went on a trip to Italy with my friends. I was exploring Sorrento, Pompeii, and a little bit of Rome. 

During this time I picked up journaling, it was a lot of fun decompressing my day into writing, and I also wrote some Haikus in the 5-7-5 form!

## The doeling
> Mehhhh, the sound of joy.<br />Nibbling on my fingers<br />With their human teeth.

At the end of one of my hikes, I came across a pen with tons of goats, adults and kids included. The young goats were so cute and made the adorable "Mehhâ€œ sound. When I stuck my finger at them, the little goat licked it and started nibbling, and that's when I saw their teeth. They look exactly like ours, maybe with a bit of an overbite though, haha.
